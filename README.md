My homework assignment for Week 1

# Assignment
Write a Python script to clip the block and block group files to six Denver Metro Counties. There are multiple ways you can approach this task in terms of geoprocessing operations. Use what makes most sense to you. You must use only Python with any libraries/modules to perform the task. Push your initial .py pseudocode file to GitHub with a commit, either using the commnd line or the web GUI as we did in the exercise. Oush your file at least one more time to track the changes you made between pushes.
